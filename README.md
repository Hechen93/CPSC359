# CPSC359
Assignment repository
C Files for my CPSC359 class with Dr. Leonard Manzara. This repo is meant to display my work on bare-metal programming with the Raspberry-Pi. Unfortunately, due to the pandemic, computer labs at school were shut down and we couldn't test our code on the physical devices. Assignment 4 code files were provided by Dr. Manzara, the files a3.c and a4main.c is the code I produced myself.

Please feel free to use this code as inspiration for side-projects. If you're a student, please check your school's policy on academic misconduct and cite code. Wouldn't want anybody to get in trouble.

Enjoy!
